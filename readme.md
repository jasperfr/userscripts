# Custom User Scripts

I've made these scripts specifically to enhance and modify most popular websites. Feel free to use them.

> How do I install them?

Just copy-paste the userscript you'd like in your Grease/Tamper-monkey (etc.) browser plugin.

> Are they safe?

Of course, and if you still have your doubts, every action has a comment explaining what's happening.

> Why did you make this?

I was sick of certain sites (Reddit, for example) not giving me the option to disable certain new "features" I definitely don't need in my life. So that's why. These scripts give you the opportunity to disable them until there's an actual option available.
